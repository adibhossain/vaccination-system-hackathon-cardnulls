Title: Smart Vaccination System

Description:
A user can login/register to our website. After logging in, they can register for vaccination by selecting a vaccine. Then a date will be assigned to them automatically depending on how many users registered for that vaccine already. The user can then download and print a form that they will show to the doctor at the vaccination place. The doctor will verify the user's vaccine registration, carry out the vaccination process, then confirm the user's vaccination on the web from their admin account. The user will now be able to download and print their vaccination certificate.

Implementation(or plans of implementation in the future):
Front end: Bootstrap,HTML,CSS, JS
Back end: PHP
Database: MySQL
Testing: Jest
Version Control: Git
CI/CD Pipeline: Github Actions
Deployment: AWS/Azure
Monitoring: AWS/Azure
Containerization: Docker
Load Balancing: AWS

Limitations:
We were unable to fully implement the mentioned processes.

Future Scope:
1) Instead of manually accessing the web to confirm a user's vaccination, the doctor can scan a QR Code on the user's form.
2) For monitoring a better tool could be Prometheus and Graffana
